OPTION 2 + OPTION 4
Asymmetric Warfare + Become The Protocol
Here's why, and here's the specific playbook:

🎯 THE STRATEGY: "DAIS-10 AS INFRASTRUCTURE"
Don't compete with tools. Become the standard they implement.
Think of it like this:

HTTP doesn't compete with browsers
SQL doesn't compete with databases
Git doesn't compete with GitHub
DAIS-10 shouldn't compete with Great Expectations

You become the PROTOCOL. They become the IMPLEMENTATION.

THE 18-MONTH PLAYBOOK
PHASE 1: PROOF OF CONCEPT (Months 1-3)
Goal: Get ONE real-world success story
Actions:

Find one company with a pain point DAIS-10 solves perfectly

Healthcare: Missing allergy data (life-threatening)
Finance: Audit failures from equal-weight validation
Target: Mid-size company (not enterprise, too slow)


Implement DAIS-10 for them (free)

You do the initial classification
You integrate with their existing tools
You document everything


Measure concrete impact:

Alert noise reduced 90%
Critical issues caught 100%
Engineering time saved: X hours/week
Cost saved: $Y/month



Deliverable: ONE case study with REAL numbers

PHASE 2: ACADEMIC VALIDATION (Months 2-4, parallel)
Goal: Get credibility via peer review
Actions:

Write academic paper

Title: "DAIS-10: A Mathematically Rigorous Framework for Semantic Data Classification"
Include: 4 theorems + proofs
Include: Benchmark results
Include: Case study


Submit to:

VLDB (Very Large Databases)
SIGMOD (Data Management)
Data Engineering Conference


Present at:

ArXiv (immediate credibility)
Medium/blog (general audience)
Reddit r/dataengineering (practitioners)



Deliverable: Published paper = legitimacy

PHASE 3: OPEN SOURCE ECOSYSTEM (Months 3-6)
Goal: Make adoption trivial
Actions:

Build integrations (NOT a competing tool):

   dais10-great-expectations    # GE plugin
   dais10-dbt                   # dbt package
   dais10-soda                  # Soda checks
   dais10-airflow              # Airflow operators

Make it brain-dead easy:

python   # Install
   pip install dais10-gx
   
   # Use
   from dais10_gx import TierExpectation
   
   expectations = TierExpectation.from_dataset(df)
   expectations.validate()  # Auto-generates tier-weighted tests

Documentation:

5-minute quickstart
Video tutorial
Migration guide from GE/Soda/etc.



Deliverable: Ecosystem that makes DAIS-10 easy to adopt

PHASE 4: COMMUNITY BUILDING (Months 4-9)
Goal: Create momentum
Actions:

Content marketing (you + help):

Weekly blog: "Why data quality tools are broken"
Case study series
Comparison articles: "GE vs DAIS-10"
Healthcare specific: "How DAIS-10 prevents patient harm"


Social proof:

Post to Reddit r/dataengineering
Hacker News submission
LinkedIn articles
Twitter thread


Engage communities:

Great Expectations Slack (show integration)
dbt Discourse (propose tier testing)
Data Council conference (submit talk)



Deliverable: Growing awareness

PHASE 5: REGULATORY CAPTURE (Months 6-12)
Goal: Make DAIS-10 mandatory via compliance
Actions:

Target healthcare first:

Write whitepaper: "DAIS-10 for HIPAA Compliance"
Show: Missing allergy data = Tier E violation
Pitch: FDA, healthcare compliance consultants


Target finance:

Write whitepaper: "DAIS-10 for SOX Compliance"
Show: Tier-weighted audit trails
Pitch: SEC, financial auditors


Standards bodies:

Submit DAIS-10 to ISO working group
Position as "ISO 8000 implementation guide"
Get ONE standards body to reference it



Deliverable: Regulatory mention = forced adoption

PHASE 6: VENDOR PARTNERSHIPS (Months 9-18)
Goal: Get big players to implement DAIS-10
Actions:

Approach Great Expectations:

"We have 10 companies using dais10-gx plugin"
"Users want native DAIS-10 support"
"We'll help you build it"
Position: Enhancement, not competition


Approach Snowflake/Databricks:

"Native DAIS-10 functions in SQL"
"TIER_IMPORTANCE() function"
"Differentiator vs competitors"


Approach dbt Labs:

"50K community wants tier-based testing"
"We have the implementation ready"
"Let's collaborate on dbt v2.0"



Deliverable: ONE major vendor integrates DAIS-10

WHY THIS WORKS:
1. You're Not Competing
You're not building "DAIS-10 vs Great Expectations"
You're building "DAIS-10 FOR Great Expectations"
2. You're Playing Where They Can't
They can't write academic papers (not their business)
They can't pivot to regulatory (too slow)
They can't be a protocol (they're products)
3. You're Creating Value For Them
"Hey dbt, we built tier-based testing that your users want"
Why would they say no?
4. You're Building A Moat
Academic paper + regulatory mention + vendor integration = Legitimacy
By the time they copy you, you're the standard

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS:
Can you do this alone?
Honestly? Almost.
You need:

Time: 15-20 hrs/week for 18 months
Help: 1-2 technical writers (contract, $5K total)
Help: 1 regulatory consultant (healthcare/finance, $10K)
Money: $15-20K for contracts + travel
Community: Reddit/HN/LinkedIn (free, just your time)

Total cost: ~$20K + your time
This is DOABLE for one person.

THE CRITICAL INSIGHT:
You can't out-resource Great Expectations.
But you CAN out-maneuver them.
They're building a product.
You're building infrastructure.
They have to satisfy customers.
You have to satisfy ONE standard.
They're defending market share.
You're creating a category.

THE ASK:
Are you willing to:

Commit 15-20 hrs/week for 18 months?
Invest $15-20K (if you have it)?
Build in public (content, social, community)?
Hustle for ONE case study?
Write ONE academic paper?
Build integrations (not compete)?

If YES → This can work.
If NO → Then accept Option 6 (move on).

MY HONEST OPINION:
This is your ONE shot.
207 commits.
Proven theorems.
Working code.
It deserves 18 months of focused effort.
If after 18 months you have:

✅ ONE case study
✅ ONE published paper
✅ ONE vendor integration

Then DAIS-10 survives.
If not, at least you tried everything.

THE QUESTION:
Are you in?
Because if you are, I'll help you build:

The case study pitch deck
The academic paper outline
The dais10-gx integration
The content marketing plan
The regulatory whitepaper
The vendor pitch

But only if you're actually going to execute.
