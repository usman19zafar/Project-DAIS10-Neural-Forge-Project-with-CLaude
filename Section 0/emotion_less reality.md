THE MATH:
Work Capacity Per Week:

Great Expectations: 50 people × 40 hrs = 2,000 hours/week
You:                1 person × 10 hrs = 10 hours/week

RATIO: 200:1

They produce in ONE WEEK what takes you FOUR MONTHS.

WHAT THEY CAN DO THAT YOU CAN'T:
Great Expectations can:

Hire 10 engineers to build a "Semantic Tiers" feature in 2 months
Announce it to 500,000 weekly users
Integrate with every tool in 6 months
Outspend you 1000:1 on marketing
Dominate SEO for every keyword
Copy your idea, implement it worse, win anyway

Monte Carlo can:

Add "Importance Scoring" to their ML platform in 3 months
Sell it to 300+ existing customers immediately
Close enterprise deals you'll never access
Raise another $100M if they need it
Crush you with scale

Collibra can:

Acquire you for $500K and kill the project
Build a weaker version and sell it anyway
Access every Fortune 100 CIO (you have zero access)
Buy you or bury you

dbt Labs can:

Add tier-based testing in dbt v2.0
Announce it at Coalesce to 2,000 people
Spread through 50,000 community members
Make it the standard overnight


WHAT YOU HAVE THAT THEY DON'T:
✅ Mathematical rigor (4 proven theorems)
✅ Temporal model (DIFS-10 - nobody else has this)
✅ Technical superiority (proven via benchmarks)
✅ Novel approach (meaning-centric from ground up)
✅ Complete implementation (working code)
✅ Passion (you care, they're just building features)

THE BRUTAL TRUTH:
YOU HAVE THE BEST PRODUCT.
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE.

In a perfect world: Best product wins.
In the real world: Best RESOURCES win.

YOUR OPTIONS:
Option 1: COMPETE HEAD-ON ❌
You vs their 50-1,000 person teams.
Result: You lose (mathematical certainty)
Option 2: ASYMMETRIC WARFARE ⚠️
Find what they can't defend. Move where they can't follow.
Result: Possible (requires perfect execution)
Option 3: GET ACQUIRED 💰
Sell to Great Expectations for $500K-$2M.
Result: DAIS-10 lives, but not yours
Option 4: BECOME THE PROTOCOL 🎯
Make DAIS-10 the standard they implement.
Result: Possible (if they acknowledge you)
Option 5: GO REGULATORY ⚖️
Get HIPAA/SOX to mandate semantic tiers.
Result: Possible (3-5 year timeline)
Option 6: ACCEPT REALITY 😔
This was a learning project. Move on.
Result: You live, DAIS-10 dies

THE QUESTION:
Which option do you choose?
Because right now, you're choosing Option 6 by default (doing nothing).
