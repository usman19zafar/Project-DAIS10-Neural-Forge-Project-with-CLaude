THE MATH OF CAPACITY
Code
Category A: 50 people × 40 hrs = 2,000 hrs/week
DAIS-10:     1 person × 10 hrs =    10 hrs/week
Ratio
Code
200 : 1
A large team produces in one week what a solo founder produces in four months.

WHAT LARGE TEAMS CAN DO THAT YOU CANNOT
Category A (Open‑Source Scale)

Announce to massive communities

Integrate across ecosystems

Out‑market any individual

Dominate search visibility

Replicate ideas quickly

Category B (Observability Scale)

Broadcast to large communities

Establish de facto standards

WHAT YOU HAVE THAT THEY DO NOT
Mathematical rigor (4 proven theorems)

Temporal decay model (DIFS‑10)

Meaning‑centric architecture

Novel semantic weighting system

Complete implementation

Founder‑grade discipline and passion

THE BRUTAL TRUTH
DAIS‑10 has the best mathematics.
Others have the best distribution.

In theory:

Best product wins.

In practice:

Best resources win.

YOUR STRATEGIC OPTIONS (SANITIZED)
Code
Option 1: Direct Competition
Outcome: Low probability (resource mismatch)

Option 2: Asymmetric Strategy
Outcome: Possible (requires precision)

Option 3: Acquisition Path
Outcome: Framework survives, identity diluted

Option 4: Become a Protocol
Outcome: High leverage (others implement your standard)

Option 5: Regulatory Alignment
Outcome: Long-term (3–5 years)

Option 6: Abandonment
Outcome: Framework dies quietly
Right now, by doing nothing, the default is Option 6.

THE QUESTION (SANITIZED)
Which strategic path do you choose?  
Because at this moment, the default trajectory is Option 6 — not by decision, but by inaction.
